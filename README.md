Part of an university project for an online poker game.
Based on the information provided on https://www.partypoker.com/en/how-to-play/hand-rankings, the application takes two sets of five Card Objects each to determine which has the higher value and would win in a round of poker. 

## Poker hands (ascending):

PAIR: two cards of the same rank <br />
TWO_PAIRS: two cards of one value and another two cards of another value <br />
THREE_OF_A_KIND: three cards of the same rank <br />
STRAIGHT: five card sequence <br />
FLUSH: five cards of the same suit <br />
FULL_HOUSE: three cards of one value and a pair of another value <br />
FOUR_OF_A_KIND: four cards of one value <br />
STRAIGHT_FLUSH: five cards sequence of the same suit <br />
ROYAL_FLUSH: straight flush with ace as highest rank <br />
